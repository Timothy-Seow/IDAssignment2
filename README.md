## Project's Name:
ID Assignment 2 - League of Legends

## Overview:
The website that I have made is based on this Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game, or MOBA for short, called League Of Legends. It is a 5 versus 5 team-based game that as a player, pick a champion, which stands for character in the game, and fight against the other team and destroy their base, allowing you to win.

The main purpose of this website is to allow anyone to get information on League Of Legends Champions and Items. Due to each champion having different abilities and each item having different bonuses, it is crucial for players to know which champion counter which champion, and which items suit each champion.

## Design Process
The primary target audience of this website is people who play League Of Legends. With the current Champion Pool of 153 Champions and more than 175 items available for purchase in a match, players need to understand each champion's abilities and each item's bonus in order to gain an advantage against their opponents and increasing their chances of winning the game. 

With so many different champion abilities and item bonuses,existing players can use this website to figure out which items suit their champions, and which are effective against the opponent.While new players can learn about different types of champions and their abilities, as well as the various items for their champions.

**User Stories:**
1. As a player, I want to know what are the statistics and abilities of a specific champion so that I know how to play against that champion.

1. As a player, I want to know what bonus does a specific item give so that I can tell whether I should buy it or not.

1. As a player, I want to learn more about different champions and its abilities so I can find out who I like to play the most.

1. As a player, I want to know more about a specific champion's story, so I can learn more about the game in general.

## Features

### Existing Features

Each item when clicked, will display information about the item, such as the bonuses it give,Active or Passive skills the item provide,description of the item,its cost and selling price (if any).

### Features Left to Implement

**Mastery** - Each Champion has a 7 mastery levels, which a player can achieve by playing and showing good performance in-game. This page will display the requirements of each mastery level.

**Runes** - The game has a rune system which allows players to use during the gameplay. Different runes have different bonuses which can affect the game. This page will allow players to know more about each rune.

**Recommended Runes** - With the Runes Page showing all the rune's information, the Recommended Runes will be displayed along with the individual champion information, so that new players will know what runes to bring for which champion.

**Recommended Items** - Almost the same as Recommended Runes but it is with Items instead. New players can refer to this to know what are the items that are recommended for this particular champion.
